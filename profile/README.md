# Hi there 👋 Welcome to InferEdge

We’re building **Supabase for AI Agents and Voice AI**.  
Our mission is to make **AI search, retrieval, and personalization** super fast so developers can build **real-time experiences** without worrying about the infra behind it.

---

## 🛠 Why We’re Here
Modern apps are becoming more **interactive and intelligent**.  
Agents, copilots, and voice-first interfaces all need the same thing:  
➡️ **instant search, retrieval, and personalization**.  

But today’s infrastructure is too slow, too cloud-heavy, and too complex.  
So we set out to fix that.  

---

## 🚀 What We’re Building
- A runtime that runs anywhere — browser, edge, or cloud
- APIs that feel simple, like using a database
- Real-time performance by default (sub-10ms retrieval)

Think **developer-first infra**: easy to adopt, hard to outgrow.  

---

## 🌱 Where We’re Headed
Right now we’re focused on:
- Voice AI agents that need low-latency search
- Multimodal agents that blend text, voice, and context
- Building the foundation for **real-time AI-native apps**

---

## 👋 Closing Note
We’re still early, but moving fast.  
If you’re a developer building in this space, we hope our work will make your life easier — and your apps faster.  

Stay tuned. ⚡️
